# Client

Small vanilla JS demo for swiping through restaurants. Start with `login.html` to enter a user name, then `index.html` will show restaurants to swipe through after the server is running. Use `friends.html` to manage your friend list.

Possible enhancements:
- Proper authentication and friend list management
- Persistent sessions so swipes are saved
- Real Tinder-style card animations (implemented with basic CSS transitions)
