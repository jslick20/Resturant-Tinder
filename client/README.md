# Client

Small vanilla JS demo for swiping through restaurants.
Start the server, then serve this directory with any static file server and open `login.html` in your browser.
After logging in you can add friends and swipe through restaurants. Swipes and friend lists are persisted on the server and card transitions mimic the Tinder app using basic CSS.
